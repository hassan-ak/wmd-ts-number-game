# Steps to code CLI Number Guessing Game

### 1. Project initiation

- Create and navigate to project directory using following commands

  ```cmd
  mkdir wmd-ts-number-game
  cd wmd-ts-number-game
  ```

- Intilize a node project in the newly created directory using following command, this will create a `package.json` file.

  ```cmd
  npm init -y
  ```

- Create a `tsconfig.json` file to define typescript configration using following command

  ```cmd
  tsc --init
  ```

- Create two more directories to be used as root and out directory using

  ```cmd
  mkdir src
  mkdir dist
  ```

- Update `tsconfig.json` to include above directories and also change module and moduleResolution

  ```json
  "target": "ES2022",
  "module": "NodeNext",
  "rootDir": "./src",
  "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
  "outDir": "./dist",
  ```

- Update `package.json` and add following content to it

  ```json
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
      "start": "node ."
  },
  "bin": "./dist/index.js",
  ```

### 2. Install dependencies

- Multiple third-party packages to be used in this project so install different dependacies using following commands

  ```cmd
  npm install inquirer
  npm install chalk
  npm install chalk-animation
  npm install ora
  npm install random-int
  ```

- Install types for the installed dependancies for the development using following set of commands

  ```cmd
  npm install --save-dev @types/inquirer
  npm install --save-dev @types/chalk
  npm install --save-dev @types/chalk-animation
  npm install --save-dev @types/ora
  npm install --save-dev @types/random-int
  ```

- After installation `package.json` file will be updated and `package-lock.json` file along with `node_modules` folder will be created. We don't need git to track newly created files and folders so create a `.gitignore` file with the following content

  ```gitignore
  node_modules
  package-lock.json
  ```
